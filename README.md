# k8s-training

# Buy VMs
1 master and 3 workers, all Debian 11 (2 cpu, 8 ram, 30 gb ssd)

```
Host k8s-train-master
  User artem
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  HostName 89.169.150.208
```

Public IPs may change, so best use yc ssh
```
yc compute ssh --identity-file /home/artem/.ssh/id_rsa --login artem --name master
```

List/Start/Stop instances:
```
# yc compute instances list
# yc compute instances start master & yc compute instances start worker1 & yc compute instances start worker2 & yc compute instances start worker3
# yc compute instances stop master & yc compute instances stop worker1 & yc compute instances stop worker2 & yc compute instances stop worker3
```


# Prepare them (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/)

Enable packet forwarding:

```
# sysctl params required by setup, params persist across reboots
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
EOF

# Apply sysctl params without reboot
sudo sysctl --system
```
